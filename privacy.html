  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: June 13, 2025</p>

  <p>FreeT (“we”, “us”, or “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our mobile app and related services (“the App”).</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect only the minimum data necessary to provide and improve our services, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email Account Access (Optional):</strong> With your explicit consent, we use OAuth to securely access your Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo inboxes to detect subscription-related emails. We request <code>gmail.readonly</code> or equivalent scopes only.</li>
    <li><strong>iOS Subscriptions:</strong> We access subscription data available via Apple's StoreKit APIs, which may include app name, billing amount, billing frequency, and status (active or trial).</li>
    <li><strong>User-Provided Data:</strong> Manually entered subscriptions, notes, and categories are stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Anonymous Usage Data (Optional):</strong> Crash logs, device type, and feature usage may be collected anonymously to help us improve the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To help you view, manage, and organize your active subscriptions and free trials</li>
    <li>To notify you about upcoming renewals or trial expirations</li>
    <li>To enhance app features and resolve bugs (using anonymized usage data)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> store or transmit any personal email content or subscription data to our servers. All data remains on your device. If you use iCloud or a device backup system, that data may be encrypted and backed up to your own cloud provider based on your OS settings.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use secure, reputable third-party services for authentication (Google Sign-In, Microsoft Authentication Library), and optionally display ads (e.g., Google AdMob). These services may collect anonymized data as described in their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>As a user, you have the following rights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The right to access the data we collect about you</li>
    <li>The right to revoke permissions via your Google, Microsoft, or device account settings</li>
    <li>The right to delete all app data by uninstalling the app or using the in-app "Delete My Data" feature</li>
    <li>The right to contact us regarding any data-related concerns</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>FreeT is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or store information from anyone under 13 years old.</p>

  <h2>7. Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>We comply with the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>, <strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong>, and <strong>Google API Services User Data Policy</strong>. We only request access to data necessary to provide subscription management features.</p>

  <h2>8. Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any updates will be posted on this page with a revised "Effective Date." Continued use of the app constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>For questions, requests, or complaints, contact us at <strong>support@freetapp.com</strong></p>
